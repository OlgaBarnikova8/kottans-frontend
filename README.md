This is a new topic for me.
Lots of new stuff.
I complete tasks slowly but surely.
Feelings about how to complete tasks without errors.
It works and it makes me happy!
Glory to Ukraine!
Glory to the heroes!

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
Linex commands is a new topic for me.
The material for study is presented in an easy and interesting way.
Especially in the case of a zoo.
I add a link to the screenshot of 4 modules, the rest of the screenshots in the repo kottans-frontend.

## HTTP
I learned that the HTTP protocol is the basis of data exchange on the Internet.
The exchange of messages between the client and the server takes place according to the "request-response" scheme.
The client initiates communication by sending an HTTP request message, in response to which the server sends an HTTP response message.
Familiarized with URL structure, methods, and status codes.
I learned that HTTPS is an extension of the HTTP protocol to support encryption in order to improve security.
The second part is more complicated. I learned more about the need to identify clients, about cookies.

Thanks to these articles, I got an idea about the HTTP protocol and the problems it solves
In the future, as a user, I will confirm cookie requests and sign up.

## Git Collaboration
I learned how it works with Git. 
Git rebase it's a new command for me. I think it will be possible to use in practice.

I learned about a good advice for project on GitHub: 
reply promptly to pull-requests;
understand any changes you accept;
use an issue tracker. 

In the https://learngitbranching.js.org level, I tried out the git rebase command (for a linear and pure sequence of commits) in practice.

I practiced a new command git fetch that is responsible for synchronization with a remote repository.
A command git fakeTeamwork surprised me (teamwork simulation).
