Lots of new stuff.
I complete tasks slowly but surely.
Feelings about how to complete tasks without errors.
It works and it makes me happy!
Glory to Ukraine!
Glory to the heroes!

Linex commands is a new topic for me.

Especially in the case of a zoo.
I add a link to the screenshot of 4 modules, the rest of the screenshots in the repo kottans-frontend.
